I was initially going to install Kali on my personal computer, but I realized that my Mac's OS was not up to date and that
I would need to install an OS update in order to get Kali up and running.
Instead, I will try using the Olin lab computers to do my assignments, and if I find that to be too much of a hassle I will bite the bullet
and update my OS and install Kali on my Mac.
